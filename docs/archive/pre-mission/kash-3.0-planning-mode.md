# Kash 3.0 — Planning Mode Spec

> The implementation spec for §8 (Planning Mode) of `kash-3.0-plan.md`. Decisions made in the
> Planning Mode session (Jun 22 2026), run page-by-page through a four-part lens:
> **(a) purpose · (b) mechanism · (c) visualization · (d) decomposition** (how goals break down into
> doable tasks and surface in day-to-day use). Companions: `kash-3.0-plan.md` (§8), `kash-3.0-build-breakdown.md` (§8).

## 0. Guardrails (locked before this session — do not reopen)

- A **"Plan"** rail item with a **zoom switcher: Week ↔ Month ↔ Quarter ↔ Year ↔ Bingo** (NAV-1, Jun 25).
  **Bingo is the 5th Plan sub-tab**, not a separate rail item.
  _(Jun 22 NAV-6 rail placement superseded Jun 25 — see `kash-3.0-plan.md` §4.)_
- Bingo/annual goals are **category-tagged** (each goal exactly one of the 5 categories).
  _(Revised Jun 22 gap-pass: the Bingo is now a literal **5×5 card** — fixed 25-cell total but
  **free category mix** per cell, so no per-category quota. See §7.)_
- Cadence is **nested**: quarterly themes set direction, monthly intentions make them concrete.
- The **balance pass** is a soft, optional closing step that suggests — **never forces**.
- The **AI** drafts horizons, rolls goals down into weeks, and references **core values (3–7, flat)** (§13).

## 1. The decomposition spine (the through-line)

A goal flows down one link per page, with progress rolling back up:

```
Annual goal → Quarter theme → Month intention → Week plan → Day (Today) tasks
        ↑__________ progress rolls back up: task done → milestone → goal % ___________|
```

Every page owns one link. Two structural consequences emerged and apply app-wide:

- **The Check-in (PM-7)** is the engine that advances this spine over time (assign horizons,
  decompose, re-assess) — incrementally, in small bites.
- **Goals promote to Projects when they grow (PM1-10, rev. §7/GP4-4)** — a goal starts as a
  lightweight panel; once it has enough milestones/tasks it's promoted to a Project (or attached as a
  phase of one), reusing Projects/Miller/Gantt (§9). Not every goal is a Project up front.

## 3. Pages

### PM-1 · Annual Goals (the Bingo page)

- **Purpose:** top of the funnel — keep _desires_ alive beside _obligations_ across all 5 categories.
- **Goal anatomy:** title · 1 category (drives balance) · optional obligation/desire flag · optional
  core-value link · hybrid progress (milestones → linked tasks) · target horizon (starts "this year").
- **Layout:** a **list** of category-colored rows; a **balance bar + gap nudge** on top
  ("Body & Mind looks light").
- **Reward:** completing one goal in _every_ category = a gentle **balance bingo** (feeds §12 garden).
- **Decomposition:** break down manually or via the Check-in; every goal is backed by a **Project**
  (milestones ≈ phases) or attached as a phase of an existing one; linked tasks schedule into weeks and
  appear in Today like any task (**no special marker**). A soft **capacity nudge** (page + Check-in)
  flags when active goals outstrip a realistic week.

### PM-2 · Year view

- **Purpose:** the only whole-year glance — spot a neglected category early; navigate into quarters.
- **Form:** **quarter cards** (theme + balance bar), each expands to a **per-week scroll**; the balance
  **heatmap is merged in** (no separate heatmap surface).
- **Encoding:** **two-level** — proportional balance bar on roomy quarter cards; dominant-color dots on
  tiny week cells. Shows **actual** attention (from completed-task/time data).
- **Interactivity:** overview + **light placement** (drag a goal onto a quarter to set its horizon).
- **Gap signal:** calm single callout by default; full **per-category strips on drill-in** (progressive
  disclosure). Goal progress is likewise hidden until you drill into a goal/quarter.

### PM-3 · Quarter view

- **Purpose:** set direction (the quarterly **theme**) and distribute the quarter's goals across months.
- **Theme:** a phrase **+ 1–2 focus categories** (structured) so the app can nudge if a focus area goes
  light and bias balance suggestions toward it.
- **Distribution:** **manual drag + AI-proposed** spread across the 3 months; AI suggestions are
  **ghosted/opt-in** (dashed; nothing moves until accepted). Unassigned goals wait in a tray.

### PM-4 · Month view

- **Purpose:** make the quarter concrete via monthly **intentions**; reserve the 1–2 self-care days.
- **Intentions:** **per-category lines** (color-coded), tied to the quarter's focus categories.
- **Layout:** **list by default, calendar on toggle** (calendar only when you need to place dates;
  avoids duplicating Week/Today).
- **Reserved days:** reserved **flexibly** ("sometime this month"); the **AI suggests specific dates**
  from free time; they become **suggested** protected blocks in the Week (§7), never hard events.

### PM-5 · Week view (planning → execution bridge)

- **Purpose:** where planning becomes doing; the handoff into Today.
- **Structure:** the **existing §7 Week view**, with a planning **rail + AI draft** that appear only in a
  **"Plan mode" toggle** (calm daily use; planning tools on demand).
- **Scheduling:** pull intended work (goal milestones + month intentions) onto days via **drag**, or
  accept a **ghosted AI week draft**.
- **Handoff:** **today's column _is_ Today** — scheduling a task sets its date; Today simply shows
  today's dated tasks. One source, no re-entry.

---

## 4. Cross-cutting mechanisms

### PM-6 · Balance pass

- Soft, **dismissible** closing step that runs **automatically at the end of planning** (day/week/horizon).
- **Two-tier model:** (1) **floor** — flag any category at near-zero attention, regardless of targets;
  (2) **target gap** — flag categories below a stated month/quarter intention or per-category target.
  Floor flags rank above target gaps; "empty + a stated focus" is the loudest.
- **Suggests from both** the existing backlog/Abyss (resurface) **and** newly generated ideas, as
  ghosted add-suggestions you accept or dismiss.

### PM-7 · Check-in

- An on-demand **+ gentle-cadence** reflective planning conversation (set/snooze the cadence).
- Reviews progress, surfaces capacity/balance, proposes a **small** next slice of planning, and updates
  goals/projects/tasks — **proposing changes and applying on confirm** (ghosted/opt-in).
- **Asks how deep to go each time**, defaulting to a small bite (ADHD-friendly). This is the engine that
  advances the decomposition spine and assigns horizons over time.
- _Deeper AI behavior (modes, About-me doc, tool catalog) belongs to §11; this spec covers only the
  Check-in's Planning role._

## 5. Data-model implications (draftable — derive during build)

New/extended tables implied by the above (RLS-scoped, SQLite-mirrored per the cross-phase rules):

- `goals` — title, `category`, `obligation_desire` (nullable enum), `value_id` (nullable → §13),
  `target_horizon` (year/quarter/month, nullable), backing `project_id`, derived progress.
- `goal_milestones` — `goal_id`, title, order, completion (derived from linked tasks).
- task ↔ goal/milestone link (likely a `milestone_id` nullable FK on `tasks`, mirroring the
  dependency-column approach).
- `quarter_themes` — period, phrase, `focus_categories[]`.
- `month_intentions` — period, `category`, text (one row per category per month).
- `reserved_days` — month, type (outside/personal), resolved date (nullable while flexible) → emit
  suggested protected blocks.

## 6. Build dependencies (not open design)

- **Reward/celebration mechanics + garden growth** → §12 Care (stub `recordBingoReward()` until Care ships).
- **Abyss as a balance-pass source** → §10 (stub empty tray until Abyss ships).
- **Values picker on goals** → §13 (`value_id` nullable until Values PR lands).
- **AI persona (modes, prompts, tool catalog)** → §11 (mock ghost payloads until persona refactor).
- **AA contrast / exact colors** → `kash-3.0-design-tokens.md`.
- **Transition motion** → animation pass (NAV-4); breadcrumb/zoom model is locked.

---

## 7. Gap-pass (Jun 22) — Bingo card + goal-planning flow

> Fills the creation/interaction holes the page-level spec skipped. **Supersedes PM1-6, PM1-8, PM1-10.**

### 7.1 The Bingo card (supersedes PM1-6, PM1-8)

- **Literal 5×5 grid, 25 cells, center is a FREE space → 24 goal cells.**
- Each cell = one goal, tagged with **any category, shown as a per-cell color**; **free mix**
  (fixed 25-cell total, no per-category quota — this is how it honors the old "no fixed-N-per-category").
- **Card is the primary surface; a List toggle** gives a dense manage view over the same goals.
- **Reward = classic line bingo** — any row / column / diagonal of 5 (the free center counts).
  _No separate "balance bingo"; balance is rewarded only incidentally when a line spans categories._

### 7.2 Bingo lifecycle (create-once → finalize → locked)

- **Draft (until you finalize, targeted by Jan 31):** add/edit/recolor cells freely; empty cells prompt
  to be filled. Populate via **AI brain-dump**, **blank-fill**, or **guided setup** (all available).
- **Finalize:** an **AI spelling pass** suggests fixes, then you **submit the final card for the year**.
- **Finalize-to-activate (GP3-1):** the card is **unusable for bingo / earns no rewards until submitted**.
  No auto-lock — it simply stays an inert draft until you commit.
- **Locked (rest of year):** **no content edits.** You may only **mark a goal done**, or
  **archive/backburner** it. Archived cells are **muted/blurred in place** (not greyed), keeping the
  grid shape intact — a bingo line cannot pass through one. A simple, low-text view distinguishes
  done / active / backburnered.

### 7.3 Goal creation (GP1-2)

Three methods, by context: **quick line** (composer-style, category via the `;` segment) for capture ·
**full form** (category, desire, value, target, first milestones) for detail · **AI brain-dump** (prose →
drafted, category-tagged goals you edit) for blank-slate setup and Check-ins.

### 7.4 Goal-planning flow (GP4 — how a goal becomes doable)

Finalizing freezes the goal **statement**, not its **execution** — milestones/tasks/decomposition
continue all year. Tapping a (locked) cell opens:

- **A lightweight goal panel (GP4-1):** statement (locked), category/value/target, hybrid progress,
  the milestone list with per-milestone task counts, and a **link out to the backing Project** (Miller/Gantt).
- **Milestones (GP4-2):** created **manually or via "AI break this down"** (ghosted, opt-in).
- **Tasks under a milestone (GP4-3):** **create new or link existing** Kash tasks (normal category/due/
  priority); they flow into Week/Today when scheduled, and completing them advances the milestone → goal %.
- **Project backing (GP4-4):** goals stay **panel-only until they grow**, then offer to **promote to a
  new Project** (milestones → phases) or **attach as a phase** of an existing one.

### 7.5 Data-model deltas vs §5

- `goals` gains a **bingo cell position** (`card_year`, `cell_index` 0–24, center index reserved/free),
  a **lifecycle status** (`draft` / `final`), and a per-goal **state** (`active` / `done` / `backburnered`).
- Add a `bingo_cards` row per user-year holding finalize state + `finalized_at`.
- `goals.project_id` becomes **nullable** (panel-only goals have none until promoted).
- Goal **statement** is immutable once `card.status = final` (enforce app-layer); status/state changes allowed.

---

## 8. Navigation & transitions (gap-pass)

- **NAV-1 · Switcher = a zoom axis.** Plan is **Week ↔ Month ↔ Quarter ↔ Year ↔ Bingo** as one
  in-page switcher on `/plan` (Jun 25). Bingo is the 5th tab, not a rail item.
- **NAV-6 · ~~Bingo rail item~~ superseded Jun 25** — Bingo lives in the Plan switcher only.
- **NAV-2 · Click a period = zoom in (replace).** Clicking a quarter/month/week opens that period's
  view, scoped to it (supersedes PM-A's inline expand).
- **NAV-3 · Full breadcrumb path.** The selected period carries down (Year › Q3 › Aug › wk34);
  zooming out returns where you were; changing zoom keeps the scoped period. Breadcrumb + zoom control
  both navigate.
- **NAV-4 · Transition motion deferred to the animation pass** — the breadcrumb/zoom model is locked;
  zoom-grow vs cross-fade is decided later.
- **NAV-5 · Default landing = last viewed** (resume where you left off).

## 9. Ghosted-accept pattern (gap-pass, reusable)

The single AI-suggestion interaction, reused by the quarter spread (PM-3), week draft (PM-5), balance
pass (PM-6), milestone breakdown (GP4-2), Check-in (PM-7), and reserved-day confirm (ET-4).

- **GA-1 · Look:** a suggestion is **dashed + faded + a ✦ "suggested" label** — unmistakably provisional.
- **GA-2 · Controls:** **per-item ✓ / ✕ only** (no bulk accept-all/dismiss-all) — every one is a conscious choice.
- **GA-3 · On accept:** ✓ **stages** the item; a final **"Apply"** commits all staged items at once.
- **GA-4 · Leftovers:** un-acted (and staged-but-un-applied) suggestions **persist as pending** for next time.
- **GA-5 · Edit-then-accept:** you can ✎-tweak a ghost (rename/recolor/reschedule) before staging it.
- **Loop:** AI proposes ghosts → ✎-tweak + ✓-stage the keepers (✕ to drop) → **Apply** commits the staged
  set → untouched ones stay pending.

## 10. Entry UIs (gap-pass)

- **ET-1 · Quarter-theme picker:** optional phrase + **any number** of focus-category chips.
- **ET-2 · Month intentions:** **all 5 category slots always shown** (empties as "—") to nudge balance.
- **ET-3 · Year light-placement:** **drag + tap-to-assign** a goal onto a quarter (from an unplaced-goals tray).
- **ET-4 · Reserved-day confirm:** ghosted-accept date with **accept / dismiss / pick-manually** (no reshuffle).
- **ET-5 · Bingo list-mode:** the list toggle off the card, with a **category ↔ status grouping toggle**.

## 11. Onboarding, rollover, capacity & reward (final gap-pass)

### 11.1 Empty / first-run / onboarding

- **ON-1:** first-run Bingo = a welcoming blank card with **three equal create options** (AI brain-dump /
  blank / guided), no default push.
- **ON-2:** empty horizons (week/quarter/month) show **minimal text only** ("nothing planned yet") —
  no AI-draft offer; calmest.
- **ON-3:** mid-year with no card → Plan works fully (goals optional); a **dismissible nudge that
  resurfaces occasionally** (via the Check-in).

### 11.2 Year rollover (Dec→Jan)

- **YR-1:** next year's card opens via a **late-Dec prompt**; **finalize-by-Jan-31 reminders escalate**
  as the date nears.
- **YR-2:** last year's card → **year-in-review summary + browsable archive**.
- **YR-3:** unfinished/backburnered goals **carried forward as opt-in ghosts** on the new card
  (ghosted-accept pattern, §9).

### 11.3 Capacity model (powers the PM1-12 nudge)

- **Available** = a **user-set weekly target, auto-refined from completion/time history** (hybrid).
- **Committed** = **sum of task time-estimates** on the goal's linked tasks → **tasks gain a
  `time_estimate` field** (data-model addition vs §5).
- **Nudge only when clearly over (~130%+)**; surfaced on the page + in the Check-in (PM1-12).

### 11.4 Reward moment

- **RW-1:** **gentle** — the completed line glows + a small in-place toast (no interrupting overlay).
- **RW-2:** a bingo **feeds the §12 garden** (grows a plant) — planning feeds wellbeing.
- **RW-3:** **escalating → blackout finale** — first bingo → double → a blackout (all 24) as the year's finale.

## 12. Foundation build contract (Jun 25 — for PR1+ parallel fan-out)

Implementation contracts for the planning data spine. Parallel PRs branch from this foundation.

### 12.1 Tables & enums

| Table                  | Purpose                                                                                                                                                        |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `bingo_cards`          | One row per user × calendar year; `status` (`draft` \| `final`), `finalized_at`                                                                                |

| `goal_milestones`      | Ordered milestones per goal; completion derived from linked tasks                                                                                              |
| `quarter_themes`       | `year`, `quarter` (1–4), `phrase`, `focus_categories` (JSON array of category enums)                                                                           |
| `month_intentions`     | One row per user × year × month × category                                                                                                                     |

| `planning_suggestions` | Persist ghosted AI suggestions (GA-4): `surface`, `payload` JSON, `status`                                                                                     |

**Task extensions:** `milestone_id` (nullable FK → `goal_milestones`), `time_estimate_minutes` (nullable, PM11.3 capacity).

**Enums:** `bingo_card_status`, `goal_state`, `obligation_desire`, `target_horizon`, `reserved_day_type`, `planning_suggestion_surface`, `planning_suggestion_status`.

### 12.2 Sync & RLS

Every table: `user_id`, `updated_at`, index `(user_id, updated_at)`, RLS owner-scoped, registered in `packages/sync/src/tables.ts` + SQLite mirror in `packages/db-local`.

### 12.3 Integration seams (Jul 1 2026)

- `recordBingoReward()` — wired → `care.recordBingoNourish` (RW-2)
- `fetchAbyssBalanceCandidates()` — wired → active Abyss items by category (PM6-1)
- Values picker — `value_id` on goals; About-me list in goal panel (§13 Values)
- AI ghosts — `planning_suggestions` + mock payloads until §11 persona breadth complete

### 12.4 Plan shell (PR1)

- Route: `/plan`
- Switcher: **Week · Month · Quarter · Year · Bingo**
- Breadcrumb: Year › Q3 › Aug › wkN (NAV-3); resume last view (NAV-5, localStorage)
- Shared **`GhostedAccept`** component (§9 GA-1–GA-5)
- `PlanHorizonPlaceholder` — fallback only when breadcrumb isn't scoped (steady-state = live horizon views)

---

## 13. Tasks across planning horizons

> Consolidates how **tasks** appear and move across the five Plan horizon tabs (Week · Month ·
> Quarter · Year · Bingo). Tasks are **global** (`tasks` table); horizons consume them via
> `milestone_id`, scheduling, and `planning_suggestions` — there is no tab-scoped task store.
> Companions: §1 decomposition spine, §7 GP4 goal panel, `kash-3.0-planning-build-plan.md`
> (build audit), `kash-3.0-plan.md` §14 for task **tags** (global spine, not owned here).

### 13.1 Locked task decisions (app-wide)

| #         | Decision             | Choice                                                                       |
| --------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| PM1-3     | Progress model       | Hybrid — milestones auto-complete from linked tasks                          |
| PM1-11    | Day-to-day marker    | **None** — goal-linked tasks look like any task                              |
| PM5-3     | Week → Today handoff | Scheduling sets `scheduled_date`; today's column _is_ Today                  |
| PM11.3    | Capacity nudge       | Committed = sum `time_estimate_minutes` on linked tasks; nudge at **~130%+** |
| Values v1 | Value link           | `value_id` on **goals only** — no `tasks.value_id`                           |
| GP4-3     | Bingo task link      | Create new or link existing tasks under a milestone                          |
| PM6-1     | Balance pass         | Resurface Abyss backlog **+** generate suggestions (ghosted)                 |
| GA-1–5    | AI suggestions       | Shared `GhostedAccept` — stage per item, Apply commits batch                 |

**Data model:** `tasks.milestone_id` (nullable FK → `goal_milestones`), `tasks.time_estimate_minutes`
(nullable). See §12.1.

### 13.2 Per-horizon tab — task role

| Tab         | Task role                                                                                      | Nested toggles                          | Spec refs         |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| **Bingo**   | Milestone CRUD; create/link tasks in goal panel; capacity nudge; promote to Project            | Card ↔ List; Category ↔ Status grouping | GP4, PM11.3, ET-5 |
| **Year**    | Indirect — drag goals onto quarters; heatmap from **completed task/time** (actual only)        | Breadcrumb zoom into quarter            | PM-2, PM2-2       |
| **Quarter** | Indirect — distribute goals across months; theme biases balance pass                           | —                                       | PM-3, ET-1        |
| **Month**   | Indirect — per-category intentions guide week; reserved days → suggested protected blocks      | List ↔ Calendar                         | PM-4, ET-2, ET-4  |
| **Week**    | **Primary task surface** — same `WeekCanvas` as `/this-week`; unscheduled inbox; AI week draft | Execute ↔ Plan mode; lens group/filter  | PM5-1–3           |

**Flow (high level):** Bingo goal panel → linked tasks → schedule on Week tab → appear on Today.
Year/Quarter/Month shape _which goals and intentions_ feed the week; they do not host task lists.

### 13.3 Week tab (primary task surface)

- **Execute / Plan mode (PM5-1):** `PlanModeToggle` on `/plan` Week tab. Plan mode ON reveals the
  planning rail (unscheduled inbox + "Draft my week" AI ghosts). Execute mode hides the rail for calm
  daily use.
- **WeekCanvas:** shared with `/this-week` — category-colored task borders, drag-to-schedule,
  protected blocks, recurrence occurrences.
- **Plan Tasks inbox:** unscheduled tasks for the scoped week (`partitionWeekTasks` + `tasks.listIncomplete`).
  Collapsible section, not a second tab bar.
- **Balance pass trigger:** closing Plan mode (toggle OFF) fires the balance pass chip (PM6-2).
- **Lens bar:** group/filter by category, priority, due (data-spine VF-3) — lives on Week tab in Plan.

### 13.4 Bingo tab (goal → task decomposition)

- Tap a placed cell → **goal panel (GP4):** locked statement, category/value, hybrid progress %,
  milestone list with per-milestone task counts, project link, promote-to-Project.
- **Milestones:** manual add or AI "break this down" (ghosted, `surface: milestone_breakdown`).
- **Tasks under milestone:** create via `tasks.create` with `milestoneId`, or link existing via
  `planning.linkTaskToMilestone`. Tasks flow to Week/Today when scheduled; completing them advances
  milestone → goal %.
- **Capacity banner (PM11.3):** when linked estimates sum to ≥130% of weekly target, soft in-panel nudge.
- **List mode (ET-5):** dense manage view; toggle group by category or status.

### 13.5 Year · Quarter · Month (indirect task surfaces)

- **Year:** quarter cards + merged heatmap encode **actual** attention from completed tasks / time
  (PM2-2). Unplaced-goals tray; drag/tap assigns `target_horizon` — no task CRUD on this tab.
- **Quarter:** theme phrase + focus-category chips; three month columns + unassigned tray; ghosted
  month spread (`surface: quarter_spread`). Goals only.
- **Month:** five category intention lines (empty = "—"); list default / calendar toggle for placing
  reserved self-care days → ghosted dates → suggested protected blocks on Week (ET-4).

### 13.6 Cross-tab mechanisms

- **Balance pass (PM-6):** auto at end of planning session; two-tier floor + target; sources include
  `fetchAbyssBalanceCandidates()` + generated suggestions; always dismissible.
- **Check-in (PM-7):** on-demand + gentle cadence; proposals as `planning_suggestions`
  (`surface: check_in`); apply via ghosts.
- **Contextual inbox/triage:** in-content panel on Today, Week, and Plan only (`kash-3.0-plan.md` §4) —
  not global.

### 13.7 Explicit non-goals

- **Task tags** (`tasks.tags`, freeform) — global §14 data spine; when built, surfaces in composer,
  task detail, and Week lens/filters. Cross-link only; spec lives in `kash-3.0-plan.md` §14 and
  `kash-3.0-data-spine-build-spec.md` Phase 5.
- **Care "Tasks" tab** — self-care library at `/care`; unrelated to Plan horizons.

### 13.8 Build status (verified Jul 1 2026)

| Area                          | Status    | Code                                                                  |
| ----------------------------- | --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Plan shell + horizon tabs     | Built     | `PlanHorizonView`, `/plan`                                            |
| Bingo task flows              | Built     | `BingoGoalPanel`, `BingoListView`                                     |
| Year / Quarter / Month        | Built     | `YearView`, `QuarterView`, `MonthView`                                |
| Week task surface + plan rail | Built     | `WeekPlanView`, `WeekCanvas`, `WeekInbox`, `WeekDraftGhosts`          |
| Schema + tRPC                 | Built     | `tasks.milestone_id`, `planning.linkTaskToMilestone`, `getGoalDetail` |
| Balance pass + Check-in       | Built     | `BalancePassProvider`, `CheckInProvider`                              |
| Abyss + Care integration      | Built     | `fetchAbyssBalanceCandidates`, `recordBingoReward`                    |
| Zoom-grow transition (AN-P1)  | Not built | Page cross-fade ships; optional PB8 polish                            |
| Task tags (§14)               | Not built | No `tasks.tags` column yet                                            |

**Verdict:** planning task-tab behavior is **shipped**; remaining work is motion polish (PB8) and
global task-tags schema (§14), not net-new planning surfaces.

### 13.9 Acceptance checklist (Jul 1 2026 audit)

| Check                                        | Result                                                         |
| -------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Link task to milestone from goal panel       | Pass — `BingoGoalPanel` → `planning.linkTaskToMilestone`       |
| Goal-linked task has no special Today marker | Pass — `TaskRow` has no milestone/goal badge (PM1-11)          |
| Week plan rail only in Plan mode             | Pass — `WeekPlanView` passes `showPlanningRail={planRailOpen}` |
| Capacity nudge at ≥130%                      | Pass — `computeGoalCapacity` + banner in `BingoGoalPanel`      |
| Balance pass on plan-mode exit               | Pass — `WeekPlanView` effect when `planRailOpen` → false       |
