# Kash 3.0 — Data Spine Build Spec (consolidated)

> **Single source of truth for building the data spine.** One doc, all phases — appended as we spec each. Decisions live in `kash-3.0-data-spine.md` (§7 decision log); this is the _implementation_ spec. Supersedes the standalone `kash-3.0-phase1-…` / `phase2-…` docs.

**Phase status**

**Overall build order:** `1 → 2 → 3 → 4` (by risk). Phases 2 (after 2A) and 3 are largely independent of 1; Design Tokens runs in parallel (only category _colors_ depend on it).

---

## Conventions (CLAUDE.md — apply to every sub-phase)

- Drizzle: **one table per file** in `src/db/schema/`; `npm run db:generate`, then **review the SQL** before commit; never edit a committed migration.
- RLS on every new table → `auth.uid()`; SQL in `supabase/rls/` (not `supabase/migrations/`).
- Zod-validate all input; every tRPC procedure has an input schema; infer TS types from Zod.
- `import "server-only"` for server modules; pure utils in `src/lib/` (no framework deps).
- Sync/offline parity: mirror schema + logic into `packages/db-local` + `packages/sync`.
- Vitest alongside code; typecheck + lint gate (no `--no-verify`); Conventional Commits; one logical change per PR.

# Phase 1 — Category on tasks

Implements the MECE category dimension end-to-end. Decisions: dedicated `category_settings` table · enum `health_wellness`→`body_mind` · strict one-per-task · inherit-from-project via shared helper · **loose-task resolver = Model C (AI-forward)** · **composer indicator = color accent bar, no chips** · semicolon-property capture + autocomplete.

> **Reconciled Jun 16 (decisions 1.4a–e).** This section was written before the loose-task decision session; the resolver and composer specs below now match `data-spine.md §7` (Model C ladder, no chips, `category_unresolved` invisible-plumbing fallback, queue-for-sync offline). The earlier "default to last-used" / "preview chip" wording is superseded.

### 1A — Schema + enum migration

- **Enum rename:** `ALTER TYPE project_category RENAME VALUE 'health_wellness' TO 'body_mind';` (no row rewrite; updates `projects`). Update `src/db/schema/projects.ts`.
- **`tasks.category`:** add `category project_category` to `src/db/schema/tasks.ts`, **nullable for now**. Plus **`tasks.category_unresolved boolean NOT NULL default false`** (1.4d invisible-plumbing flag) and **`app_settings.last_used_category`** (habit layer).
- **`category_settings`** (new `src/db/schema/category-settings.ts`): `user_id, category, label?, color?, sort_order, weekly_target?`, timestamps; PK `(user_id, category)`.
- **RLS** for `category_settings` in `supabase/rls/`. `db:generate` → review → commit.
- **Accept:** migration clean; column exists (nullable); table + RLS exist; project rows read `body_mind`.

### 1B — Backfill + NOT NULL

- Seed 5 `category_settings` rows/user (default labels, placeholder colors). Until the settings editor (1E) ships, the accent bar + task-row stripe read `PROJECT_CATEGORY_META`, not the DB.
- Project tasks ← project's category (SQL update). Loose tasks ← AI pass (`scripts/backfill-loose-task-categories.cjs`, same `inferCategoryFromTitle` as runtime) → user review → apply. Rows the AI can't resolve stay `category_unresolved=true`.
- Then second migration sets `tasks.category` **NOT NULL** (the column is created nullable in 1A).
- **Accept:** zero NULLs; seeded; NOT NULL; AI assignments spot-checked.
- **Status (2026-06-18):** ✅ enum rename `health_wellness`→`body_mind` migrated; ✅ backfill shipped (`scripts/backfill-loose-task-categories.cjs`, Haiku + floor/margin gate per Q2) and run on local → 0 NULLs, 10 unresolved markers held back. ⬜ **NOT NULL migration still pending** (next step). Per-category `category_settings` seeding stays lazy (rows created on first edit); the accent bar + stripe still read `PROJECT_CATEGORY_META`.

### 1C — Loose-task resolver (shared TS) — **Model C, AI-forward**

- Pure ladder `src/lib/tasks/resolveTaskCategory.ts`: **explicit → project.category → AI(if confident) → lastUsed → Unresolved(`adulting` + `category_unresolved=true`)**. `inferCategoryFromTitle` injected (returns `{category, confidence}`); confidence `THRESHOLD` gates whether AI outranks habit (1.4c). Server wrapper `src/server/tasks/resolve-task-category.ts` gathers project/last-used and (1H) precomputes the async embedding inference, injecting it into the pure sync resolver; `infer-category.ts` is the AI seam (✅ now the real embeddings provider, was the abstaining stub). `online:false` skips the AI layer (offline / client preview).
- **lastUsed update:** set `last_used_category` to the resolved category on create, **except the unresolved fallback** (don't poison habit).
- **Accept:** pure, framework-free, fully tested; server + offline + client-preview import it.

### 1D — Composer: category as semicolon property + autocomplete + **accent bar (no chips)**

- Parser (`parse-quick-input.ts`): recognize a category-name segment → emit `category`, matched before the project slug (`fuzzy-category.ts`, key/label normalized).
- Assist (`composer-assist.ts`): add `category` as the 5th property slot; autocomplete the 5 labels (ghost text); Tab accepts.
- UI **= color accent bar, NOT a chip** (1.4b): `ComposerCategoryAccent.tsx` renders the left accent bar + faint trailing label + neutral "no category yet" marker for unresolved; preview via `previewLineCategory` (resolver, `online:false`). `ComposerPropertyBar.tsx` shows the category hint chip; `QuickInput.tsx` passes `category` to `create`.
- **⚠ Bundle the `#project`-token retirement here** (plan §14 cleanup) — same files; one composer refactor. _(✅ done, Q6 — space-mode `#project` token retired; project set only via the `;` segment. Live accent bar now also shows the AI guess via 1H.)_
- **Accept:** `Call mom; tomorrow; relationships` files under Relationships, title "Call mom"; autocomplete + accent bar work (no chip).

### 1E — tRPC + task UI

- `tasks.ts` router: `category` in `create`/`update` Zod; `create` calls the resolver; `update` with an explicit category clears `category_unresolved`. New `category-settings` router (`get`/`update`/`reorder`) — ✅ **built** (labels + sort order only, Q3; color read-only, weekly targets schema-only).
- `TaskRow.tsx`: category **left stripe** (color when resolved, neutral marker when unresolved). `TaskDetail.tsx`: category field. `SettingsForm.tsx`: settings editor. _(✅ Stripe on plan day view; ✅ task-detail category field (Q5 — detail-panel only, no row chip); ✅ settings editor `CategorySettingsSection` with inline label edit + up/down reorder. All verified live.)_
- **Accept:** create/edit category via UI; row shows the life-area stripe; settings persist everywhere.

### 1F — Sync / offline parity

- `packages/db-local`: `category` + `category_unresolved` on SQLite tasks, `last_used_category` on app_settings, new `category_settings` table (idempotent ADD COLUMN for existing DBs). `packages/sync`: register `category_settings`; row-mapper round-trips `category_unresolved` boolean↔0/1; offline create uses the resolver with `online:false`.
- **Offline categorizes live (1.4e superseded by 1.AId):** the local embedding model runs on-device, so offline create resolves the category locally — **no reconnect re-resolve loop**. Any `category_unresolved` rows are cleaned up by the bulk backfill (0.3), not a reconnect trigger.
- **Accept:** offline create carries a locally-resolved category and syncs; settings sync both ways.

### 1G — Verification

- Vitest: helper (1C), parser (1D), backfill (1B). Manual QA: capture, inheritance+override, chip edit, settings, offline→sync, NULL check. Gates: typecheck, lint, RLS audit.

### 1H — AI inference provider (embeddings) — _decisions 1.AIa–d_ — ✅ **built (2026-06-18)**

> Shipped: pure `category-classifier.ts` (cosine + softmax floor/margin, unit-tested); `category-prototypes.ts` seed titles; `embed-text.ts` local all-MiniLM-L6-v2 int8 via transformers.js (dynamic import, memoized); `category-inference.ts` provider; server seam precomputes async inference into the pure resolver; live composer accent bar via debounced `useLiveCategoryInference`. Verified: "Call mom"→Relationships, "Pay the electricity bill"→Adulting (live bar + server-create); gibberish abstains. Knobs (temp 0.1 / floor 0.70 / margin 0.10) are first-pass and tunable.

Replaces the abstaining `infer-category.ts` stub with the real classifier:

- **Embeddings nearest-prototype (1.AIb):** seed 5 category **prototype vectors** from a handful of example titles per category (embed once, cache). `inferCategoryFromTitle(title)` = embed title → cosine vs the 5 prototypes → top match + score.
- **Confidence = floor + margin (1.AIc):** return `{category, confidence}` only when top ≥ floor (≈0.70) **and** top − 2nd ≥ margin (≈0.10); else abstain (`null`) so the ladder falls to last-used. Both knobs tunable/config.
- **Location = hybrid (1.AId):** small **local** model (ONNX/transformers.js, ~few MB) for the **live + offline** path, injected on client/server/offline behind the existing seam; **sharper hosted model** (hosted embeddings or Haiku) only inside `scripts/backfill-loose-task-categories.cjs` (1B).
- **Trigger = live per keystroke (1.AIa):** the composer calls inference debounced (~150ms), cached by normalized title, so the accent bar updates as you type. _Open: keep per-keystroke cost at/near free (local model + cache); revisit model choice if not._
- **Accept:** "Call mom" → Relationships above threshold; ambiguous titles abstain to last-used; live accent bar updates while typing; offline categorizes with no network; backfill uses the sharper model.

**Order:** `1A → 1B → 1C → (1D ∥ 1E) → 1F → 1G → 1H`. (Spine 1A–1G works with the stub; 1H lights up AI-forward.)

# Phase 2 — Time-tracking on any task

Capture is **already built** (`timeEntries.start({taskId})` works on any task; `useFocusTimeEntry` logs in Focus). This phase = **aggregation + the weekly review**. No `task_time_entries` schema change. Decisions: derive category (not snapshot); weekly roll-ups by category + project.

### 2A — Verify & ungate capture

- Test a loose task can be tracked; remove any Projects-only UI gating so time shows on any task. Optional: manual entry; optional index `task_time_entries (user_id, started_at)`.
- **Accept:** any task trackable + shows total; loose-task test passes.

### 2B — Category-derived time roll-up _(needs Phase 1)_

- `src/lib/timeline/time-by-category.ts`: sum durations per category over a range (join entries→`tasks.category`); handle open entries. Server query respects RLS. Tested.
- **Accept:** "time per category, this week" correct; no uncategorized.

### 2C — Time-per-project + completion %

- Time grouped by `tasks.project_id` (null = none). **Completion %** (`src/lib/projects/completion.ts`): `completed weight ÷ total weight`, Top-3-weighted. Exposed via `projects`/`phases` router.
- **Accept:** project time totals correct; each project/phase reports 0–100% matching weights.

### 2D — End-of-week review surface (plan §7.6)

- tRPC `weeklyReview` aggregating 2B + 2C for the ISO week. Review surface: category time + project time + progress bars (reuse `FocusTimeChart` language). Reflection & care AI voice narrates.
- **Accept:** weekly review shows accurate time-per-category/project + % progress; AI summary reads naturally.

### 2E — Surface in Today + verification

- Show tracked time on tasks in Today (detail/Review). Vitest: 2B/2C + edge cases. Manual QA: reconcile review vs raw entries. Gates: typecheck, lint, RLS.

**Order:** `2A → 2B → 2C → 2D → 2E` (2A independent; 2B/2D need Phase 1).

---

# Phase 3 — Task dependencies (project-scoped)

**Your decisions (each cited below):** A blocks B · within a project only · **blocked-by-one / blocks-many** · cycles **prevented** · a blocked task stays **visible but visually distinct** (treatment C: dashed border + striped category bar + lock + "waiting on X") · the RDM **skips** blocked tasks · blocker pick-weight **scales with how many it unblocks** · adding a **2nd blocker is rejected** (clear the current one first) · deleting a blocker **frees** the blocked task · created/removed in **both** task detail and the Miller/Gantt board.

> **Two mechanical consequences flagged (say if you'd rather differ):** a task can't block itself (self-links rejected); completing a blocker frees the blocked task (the natural inverse of "blocked until unblocked").

### 3A — Schema

- Because dependencies are **blocked-by-one**, the blocker is a single nullable FK **column on the task**, not a join table: add `blocked_by_task_id uuid → tasks(id) on delete set null` to `src/db/schema/tasks.ts`. This **structurally enforces "at most one blocker"** (your 2nd-blocker-reject decision), makes "blocks many" the natural inverse (many tasks point at one blocker), and means **deleting a blocker frees the blocked task** automatically (`set null`) — matching your delete decision with no extra logic. _(Flag if you'd prefer a separate `task_dependencies` join table.)_
- Same-project is a **write-time app check** (blocker & blocked share a non-null `project_id`).
- Index on `blocked_by_task_id`. RLS already covers `tasks`. `db:generate` → review → commit.
- **Accept:** column + index exist; deleting a blocker nulls the reference (frees the task); cross-project links rejected.

### 3B — Mutations + guards

- `tasks` router gains `setBlocker({ taskId, blockerId })` + `clearBlocker({ taskId })`.
- **Guards (app layer):** same project; reject **self-link**; reject if the task **already has a blocker** (your "clear first" decision); reject any link that would **cycle**.
- Cycle check — pure helper `src/lib/tasks/dependency-cycle.ts`: walk the `blocked_by` chain from the proposed blocker; if it returns to this task, reject. (Blocked-by-one makes the graph simple chains/trees, so this is a chain walk, not full-graph DFS.)
- **Accept:** valid links set; self / second-blocker / cross-project / cycle all rejected with clear messages.

### 3C — Blocked state + RDM

- Pure helpers `src/lib/tasks/blocked-state.ts`: `isBlocked(task, tasksById)` (blocker exists and is incomplete); `unblockCount(taskId, tasks)` (how many incomplete tasks it blocks).
- **RDM skips blocked** (your decision): exclude `isBlocked` tasks from the RDM pools (`pick-task.ts`, `pick-work-on-task.ts`). They still render in lists.
- **Scaled blocker boost** (your decision): in `computeWorkOnWeight` (`pick-work-on-task.ts`), add a boost proportional to `unblockCount` so the biggest bottleneck surfaces first.
- Completing or deleting the blocker → `isBlocked` becomes false → task is actionable again (no extra write).
- **Tests:** `blocked-state.test.ts`; extend `pick-work-on-task.test.ts` (skip + scaled boost).
- **Accept:** blocked tasks never auto-picked; a blocker of 3 outranks a blocker of 1; finishing the blocker frees the task.

### 3D — UI: treatment C + create/remove on both surfaces

- **Treatment C** on blocked rows — `TaskRow.tsx` and project rows (`MillerTaskRow.tsx`): dashed border, striped category bar, lock icon, "waiting on <blocker>".
- **Create/remove — both** (your decision): a blocker picker in `TaskDetail.tsx` (autocomplete same-project tasks) + clear; and visual linking in `MillerColumnsView` / `GanttRow` / `GanttBar`.
- **Accept:** blocked rows show treatment C everywhere they appear; you can set/clear a blocker from task detail and from the project board.

### 3E — Sync + verification

- Sync the new `blocked_by_task_id` column (`packages/db-local`, `packages/sync`); the cycle + blocked helpers (pure) run offline too.
- **Tests:** cycle prevention, same-project guard, second-blocker reject, scaled boost, RDM skip, delete-frees.
- **Manual QA:** A blocks B → B shows treatment C, RDM skips B, A's odds rise per task it blocks; finish/delete A → B free; second blocker rejected; offline parity.
- **Gates:** typecheck, lint (RLS unchanged — lives on `tasks`).

**Order:** `3A → 3B → 3C → (3D ∥ 3E tests)`. Independent of Phases 1–2.

# Phase 4 — Recurrence

Recurring tasks via **RRULE (rrule.js)** behind a friendly Repeat picker. Decisions: ends = date/count/never · **virtual occurrences** (one template + computed dates + overrides) · **full single-occurrence control** (complete/skip/reschedule/edit one) · entry via **Repeat picker + composer shorthand**.

### 4A — Schema

- New `src/db/schema/task-recurrence.ts`: `id, user_id, task_id → tasks(id) on delete cascade` (unique — a task IS the template), `rrule text` (e.g. `FREQ=WEEKLY;BYDAY=TU;UNTIL=…` — end is encoded in the rule), `start_date`, `created_at, updated_at`.
- New `src/db/schema/task-occurrence-overrides.ts`: `id, user_id, recurrence_id → task_recurrence(id) on delete cascade, occurrence_date date, status` enum `completed | skipped | rescheduled | edited`, `moved_to_date date NULL` (rescheduled), `patch jsonb NULL` (edited fields), `completed_at NULL`, `created_at`. Unique `(recurrence_id, occurrence_date)`.
- "Is this task recurring?" = join `task_recurrence` (no denormalized flag). A recurring template's own `scheduled_date` is unused — dates come from the rule.
- RLS `auth.uid()` on both. `db:generate` → review → commit.
- **Accept:** a task can hold one recurrence rule; overrides table exists; both RLS-scoped.

### 4B — Occurrence generation (shared pure util)

- `src/lib/recurrence/expand.ts`: `expandOccurrences(rrule, startDate, window)` → occurrence dates in a window via **rrule.js**, then **merge overrides** (drop skipped, move rescheduled, apply edited patches, mark completed). `nextOccurrence(rrule, from)` for reminders.
- Runs on **server** (Today/Week/calendar queries) and **client** (offline) — rrule.js works in both.
- **Tests:** weekly/monthly/interval, UNTIL/COUNT/never, overrides applied, month-end/DST (rrule.js handles).
- **Accept:** rule + window → correct dates with overrides; identical online/offline.

### 4C — Rendering in Today / Week

- Today/Week/calendar queries **expand templates into virtual occurrence rows** for the visible range (4B), each rendered like a normal task with a small **↻ recurring badge**, carrying the template's category/priority/project + the occurrence date.
- Occurrences are **date-anchored** to the rule (or an override's `moved_to_date`); they sort alongside normal `scheduled_date` tasks. You don't free-bucket them — but you can reschedule a single one (4D).
- **Accept:** a weekly task shows on its days with a ↻ badge; completing/skipping affects only that date.

### 4D — Single-occurrence actions (full)

- From an occurrence's row/menu: **complete** → override `completed` (+ `completed_at`); **skip** → override `skipped`; **reschedule** → override `rescheduled` + `moved_to_date`; **edit this** → override `edited` + `patch`.
- The series is untouched; the next occurrence appears on its date.
- **Accept:** each action persists as one override and renders correctly; series unaffected.

### 4E — Recurrence editing (picker; this vs all-future)

- The **Repeat picker** (task detail) sets/edits the rule (frequency · interval · byday · ends).
- **"Edit all future"** = update the rule in place (forward-looking); past overrides stay valid (they're keyed by date). _(The decision-log "split the rule" intent is realized simply as in-place forward update for v1, since one task = one rule; a true two-series split is a later refinement.)_ **"Edit this only"** = an override (4D).
- **Accept:** changing the picker updates future occurrences; past completions unaffected.

### 4F — Composer shorthand

- Parser (`parse-quick-input.ts`): recognize a recurrence phrase in a `;` segment ("every tue", "daily", "every other week", "monthly on the 1st") → an RRULE (rrule.js text parsing + a small phrase map); render a ↻ chip in the preview; on create, attach a `task_recurrence`.
- **Accept:** `water plants; every tue` creates a task with a weekly-Tue rule.

### 4G — Sync, RLS, verification

- Sync `task_recurrence` + `task_occurrence_overrides` (`packages/db-local`, `packages/sync`); the expand util (pure) runs offline.
- **Tests:** expansion (4B), single-occurrence overrides (4D), shorthand parse (4F), edit-all-future (4E). Manual QA: create via picker + shorthand; complete/skip/move one; offline parity. Gates: typecheck, lint, RLS audit.

**Order:** `4A → 4B → 4C → (4D ∥ 4E ∥ 4F) → 4G`. Independent of Phases 1–3.
